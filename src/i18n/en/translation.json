    "title": "Our Journey",
    "paragraph1": "For more than three years, we've loved each other across thousands of miles, learning what it means to love from a distance. You often say our love is like the tale of the Weaver and the Cowherd—seeing each other only a few times a year. And each meeting requires so much effort crossing continents, with memories captured through travels. Yet looking back, we've had so few moments together on special days. Somehow, everything unfolded gently and warmly, in ways we couldn't quite understand.",
    "paragraph2": "Our love has been nurtured through sharing, understanding, and learning from mistakes and challenges. It grew through late-night conversations across time zones, adjusting our schedules for one another. Despite the distance, you've always been my source of strength and the one who brings laughter to my long days. There were many moments when I realized that when you find the right person, everything flows naturally.",
    "paragraph3": "Perhaps because we're always apart, it makes us even more eager and hopeful for the days when we can be together. In June 2025, you proposed to me on Dreamland Beach in Bali, with the sunset and ocean waves as witnesses. That land of dreams granted me my greatest dream—when you received my yes."
